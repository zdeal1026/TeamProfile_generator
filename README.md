## Description

In this project we built a team profile generator and made tests to test the application. It was very challenging and I spent alot of time on this project. There was alot of research in this project and alot of youtube videos, along with alot (and I mean alot) of trouble shooting.

## Installation

open the project, run "npm i" to install node modules, and use the .gitignore file to hold the nodules that you don't want to upload to github
*For this project I had problems installing the node modules. I kept getting the ERNOENT (error no entry) error. When I researched it, google said it was a path issue but all my paths were correct. I know they were correct because if they are pathed correctly you can hold control and click on it, and if it is pathed directly it will take you to the file you are pulling. I tried deleting the modules and reinstalling and that didn't work. I really don't know why I couldn't install them but I created another way to add them. I copied the node_modules folders from the lessons and added them to the file. Then I installed Jest and Inquirer independently. I also had to clear the cache from the command line and run a command I found on google to fix it (I tried looking for the code I ran but it's not in my history and I can't find it again on google but I will keep looking).

## Usage

open the index.js file in the terminal and from the command line run the command "node index.js", you will then be prompted from the inquirer package that we installed to answer questions for your team profile generator, when you finish answering the questions your file will be generated.
